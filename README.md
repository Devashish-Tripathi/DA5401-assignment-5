# DA5401: Assignment 5

Submitted by: **Devashish Tripathi**

Roll Number: **DA25C006**

Public repository for the Assignment 5 for the course DA5401.

Assignment is contained in the [DA5401_Assignment5_DA25C006.ipynb](DA5401_Assignment5_DA25C006.ipynb) file. All sections have been run. In case rerun is to be done, you can get the data (yeast data) from [MULAN](https://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html). Keep it in the same folder as the notebook. The libraries needed are provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). The code runs in a jupyter environment. 

I have used italics in the markdown wherever I have stated some observation or fact, to distinguish it from the rest of the markdown text.

Thank you :)
